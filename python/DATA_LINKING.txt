HOW EMPLOYEE DATA, SKILLS, AWARDS & TAXONOMY ALL LINK TOGETHER
================================================================================

THE LINKING MECHANISM - USING IDs AS KEYS
================================================================================

Think of it like a library system:
• Each book has ISBN (unique ID)
• Catalog links books by ISBN
• Everything connects through IDs

In our system:
• employee_id = unique employee identifier
• skill_id = unique skill identifier
• category_id = unique award category identifier
• award_id = unique award identifier

================================================================================
HOW DATA IS LINKED (The Flow)
================================================================================

STEP 1: TAXONOMY GENERATION (Already Done)
─────────────────────────────────────────
Claude analyzed 1000 award messages
│
Generated 6 categories:
├─ A = Leadership & Management
├─ B = Innovation & Business Impact
├─ C = Customer & Client Focus
├─ D = Teamwork & Collaboration
├─ E = Professional Excellence
└─ F = Social Responsibility & Culture
│
Stored in: award_categories.csv

STEP 2: AWARDS ARE CATEGORIZED (Already Done)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Each of 1000 award messages was:
1. Read by Claude
2. Matched to category (A, B, C, D, E, or F)
3. Reasoning generated
4. Stored with category_id

Stored in: awards.csv

Example:
  award_id: AWD00001
  award_message: "Thank you for business impact..."
  category_id: B ← Links to award_categories.csv
  reasoning: "Delivering business impact and results"

STEP 3: AWARDS LINKED TO EMPLOYEES (Already Done)
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Each award has:
  recipient_id: EMP0051 ← Links to employees.csv (who got award)
  nominator_id: EMP0019 ← Links to employees.csv (who gave award)

Example:
  AWD00001 from EMP0019 (nominator) to EMP0051 (recipient)

STEP 4: EMPLOYEES HAVE SKILLS (Already Done)
──────────────────────────────────────────
employee_skills.csv links employees to skills:

  employee_id: EMP0001
  skill_id: SKILL06
  proficiency_level: Intermediate

EXAMPLE: COMPLETE FLOW
================================================================================

Let's trace one award:

TAXONOMY WAS GENERATED:
  award_categories.csv has: B = "Innovation & Business Impact"

AWARD WAS CREATED & CATEGORIZED:
  awards.csv row 2:
    award_id: AWD00001
    category_id: B ← Taxonomy category!
    recipient_id: EMP0051
    nominator_id: EMP0019
    award_message: "Thank you for pod submission..."
    reasoning: "Delivering business impact" ← Claude-generated

WHEN YOU OPEN DASHBOARD:
  app.js loads data:
    1. Loads awards.csv
    2. Loads employees.csv
    3. Loads award_categories.csv

  When displaying award AWD00001:
    1. Gets category_id: B
    2. Looks up category_name from award_categories.csv: "Innovation & Business Impact"
    3. Gets recipient_id: EMP0051
    4. Looks up employee name: "EMP0051" = "Some Employee"
    5. Gets nominator_id: EMP0019
    6. Looks up nominator name: "EMP0019" = "Nominator Name"
    7. Displays:
       Title: Innovation & Business Impact Award
       From: [Nominator Name] (EMP0019)
       To: [Recipient Name] (EMP0051)
       Category: B
       Reasoning: Delivering business impact
       Message: Thank you for pod submission...

================================================================================
HOW THE CODE LINKS THEM (backend/app.py)
================================================================================

When you request GET /api/employees/EMP0051

Backend does:
  1. Load employees.csv
  2. Find row with employee_id = EMP0051
  3. Load awards.csv
  4. Find all rows where recipient_id = EMP0051
  5. For each award:
     a. Load award_categories.csv
     b. Find category matching category_id
     c. Add category_name to award data
  6. Load employee_skills.csv
  7. Find all rows with employee_id = EMP0051
  8. Return complete employee profile:
     {
       employee_id: EMP0051,
       first_name: ...,
       awards_received: [
         {
           award_id: AWD00001,
           category_id: B,
           category_name: "Innovation & Business Impact",
           reasoning: "...",
           nominator: {name: ..., id: ...}
         },
         ...
       ],
       skills: [
         {skill_id: SKILL01, proficiency: Expert, ...},
         ...
       ]
     }

Frontend receives this JSON and displays it!

================================================================================
HOW DATA WAS GENERATED (Process)
================================================================================

PHASE 1: CREATE TAXONOMY
  • Started with raw award messages (1000+)
  • Sent sample to Claude
  • Claude analyzed and created 6 categories (A-F)
  • Stored in: award_categories.csv

PHASE 2: ANNOTATE AWARDS WITH TAXONOMY
  • Took all 1000 award messages
  • For each: "Which category (A-F) fits this?"
  • Claude/Llama assigned category_id
  • Claude generated reasoning
  • Stored in: awards.csv
  • Result: Each award now has category_id + reasoning

PHASE 3: CREATE EMPLOYEE DATA
  • Generated 60 realistic employees
  • Assigned departments, salaries, dates
  • Stored in: employees.csv

PHASE 4: LINK AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES
  • For each award, randomly assigned:
    • recipient_id (who gets award) = pick random employee
    • nominator_id (who gives award) = pick different random employee
  • Stored in: awards.csv

PHASE 5: LINK SKILLS TO EMPLOYEES
  • For each employee, assigned relevant skills
  • Stored in: employee_skills.csv

================================================================================
KEY LINKING POINTS (IDs ARE THE GLUE)
================================================================================

awards.csv → award_categories.csv
  Link via: category_id

  awards.csv.category_id = award_categories.csv.category_id

  Example: category_id = "B" in awards.csv → finds "B" row in award_categories.csv

awards.csv → employees.csv (RECIPIENT)
  Link via: recipient_id

  awards.csv.recipient_id = employees.csv.employee_id

  Example: recipient_id = "EMP0051" in awards.csv → finds EMP0051 in employees.csv

awards.csv → employees.csv (NOMINATOR)
  Link via: nominator_id

  awards.csv.nominator_id = employees.csv.employee_id

  Example: nominator_id = "EMP0019" in awards.csv → finds EMP0019 in employees.csv

employee_skills.csv → employees.csv
  Link via: employee_id

  employee_skills.csv.employee_id = employees.csv.employee_id

  Example: employee_id = "EMP0001" in employee_skills.csv → finds EMP0001 in employees.csv

employee_skills.csv → skills.csv
  Link via: skill_id

  employee_skills.csv.skill_id = skills.csv.skill_id

  Example: skill_id = "SKILL06" in employee_skills.csv → finds SKILL06 in skills.csv

================================================================================
WHEN YOU UPLOAD YOUR OWN DATA
================================================================================

If you want to generate taxonomy for YOUR OWN awards:

1. Prepare CSV with your award messages:
   ├─ award_message (the text to categorize)
   ├─ recipient_employee_id (who gets award)
   └─ nominator_employee_id (who gives award)

2. Run: python backend/taxonomy_pipeline.py
   ├─ Analyzes messages
   ├─ Generates/uses taxonomy (A-F categories)
   ├─ Assigns category_id to each award
   ├─ Generates reasoning
   └─ Creates output CSV

3. Import into data/awards.csv
   └─ All linking works automatically (IDs match)

4. Link to your employee data:
   └─ Just make sure your employee_id matches in both CSVs

5. Dashboard instantly shows everything!

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

Everything links through IDs:
  • employee_id links employees to awards (recipient/nominator)
  • category_id links awards to taxonomy (categories)
  • skill_id links employees to skills
  • award_id uniquely identifies each award

The TAXONOMY (award_categories.csv) was:
  ✅ Generated using Claude (Phase 1)
  ✅ Applied to all 1000 awards (Phase 2)
  ✅ Stored with reasoning for each award
  ✅ Linked to employees via recipient/nominator IDs

When you use the dashboard:
  1. Click employee → shows all awards where recipient_id matches
  2. See award → shows category name via category_id lookup
  3. Filter by category → matches category_id in taxonomy

All data is CONNECTED through these ID links!
