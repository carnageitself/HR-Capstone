10,2025-02-03,2026 was a HUGE win for WH Media.,"As 2026 nears to an end I need to acknowledge the enormous win we have realized for WH Media and Workhuman at large. When comparing our advertising capability and experience from the beginning of the year to the end, it couldn't be more different. Our store has been brought to life with native but visually interesting and engaging ads that objectively improve the experience. That experience all started with a good design and vision for where we're going and what would be commercially viable. With that vision in place this team got to work with the various integrations which often required on the fly creative solutioning and incredible patience with our ad server partner, Osmos. Creating the inventory and ad units also required us to solve quite a few unforeseen challenges given the unique white labeled nature of our catalog and experience.  On top of all this the team was held to extremely rigid deadlines where sold ads needed to launch on a specific date. This made releasing tedious and required extensive orchestration with legacy ad commitments. This series of work positions us so well to grow this business. I can't wait for us to tackle the next big thing in 2026. Well done everyone!",1000,1374,David Gonzalez,ML Engineer,Data Science,VP,"Strategic Planning,Market Analysis,Documentation,Process Control",1414,William Jackson,Data Analyst,Data Science,Senior Manager,B,Innovation & Problem Solving,B3,Creative Problem Solving,Provided creative problem-solving approach

You challenged ideas, debated strongly and aligned quickly. The trust we have for each other translates directly into impact for the business, and it showed in every release we shipped. But even more, what makes this team special, goes beyond delivery velocities and roadmaps. You bring kindness into our day-to-day interactions. You create space for different opinions, backgrounds, and working styles. You help each other learn. You help make work a place people enjoy coming to. We can laugh after a tough sprint, celebrate small wins, support each other on hard days – that's the culture we have built. Thank you for the partnership, the friendship, the patience, the humour, and the trust.

206,2025-09-14,Prioritizing YOS performance,"Thank you both for prioritizing and implementing the fix for Service Years scheduled job. We noticed a few months back that it was getting cutoff every day when it clashed with the release processes and additionally running into the following day for the second run. Service Years is a very important part of our system, that needs to run twice every day to guarantee delivery of emails and awards to literally thousands of people everyday. As you found out, some time back an unfortunate, seemingly small change, was made to seriously degrade the performance of the job, by an unrelated team. Viktor, you painstakingly identified the issue, zeroing in on where the time was been lost and implemented a fix delivering it to production on 10th Dec. We can now see Service Years has gone from taking ~7 hours on a typical day to ~3 hours on a typical day (heavy days can be multiple times). Marcus - this improvement would not have happened without your partnership and recognition of its importance to the normal running of the business, juggling other high pressure, high priority work items like 'media processing' and award loading for a new client launch. I know and recognize that was tricky to accomplish. Really appreciate both of your efforts on this and whoever else was involved, both in implementation and prioritization, that might have been invisible to me.

Not enough words to described the incredible positive impact you've had since starting your TechFlow tenure which, believe it or not, it's barely 7 months old.

But on top of it, you also had the entire company onboarding process, so... water from a fire-hose x1000?! Through it all and since, you've been a leader who's supportive, empathetic, collaborative, decisive, thoughtful, inclusive, and – probably more importantly – a someone who sees and believes in their people and their potential for growth.

284,2025-11-05,Quest for the halo effect of search marketing,"Congratulations to this group for supporting a real-life behavioral science experiment—quantifying the halo effect of paid media on website traffic and responses. As a business, we've known for years that core drivers of Demo Requests and Contact Us Sales responses come from direct load, organic search, and paid search sources. In 2025 we had the chance to observe for the first time ever what it would mean if one of those 3 sources shut off—the advertising freeze! The correlation was clear: paid search went to 0 while organic search and direct load traffic to the employee engagement platform page and responses dropped over 60%. The trend line was compelling, but we needed to rule out other factors. Sarah, Alex, and Emma—you supported the analysis understanding organic trends, proving that in fact core employee recognition terms were gaining organic ranking ground and search traffic fluctuation was negligible. David and Michael, you were at the helm of NA and EMEA paid search this year, pivoting by month and by quarter as budgets shifted and took on in-house management responsibility with the relaunch in December. As we go full-steam ahead in January, I look forward to watching the trend line reverse. This time we'll be able to better calculate total business ROI and make optimizations accordingly.

380,2025-05-03,Innovation Award Popular Choice 1st Place,"Congratulations on winning the Popular Choice Award to Smart Diagnostics, an innovation that our engineering community is excited about. This innovation started with a simple but powerful insight: our engineers were losing too much time hunting through logs, dashboards, ticket systems, and documentation just to understand what went wrong. This team set out to change that, and they delivered something remarkable. Smart Diagnostics is an AI-driven incident analyst that aims to automatically interprets error logs and stack traces, identifies ownership, pulls relevant context from across our ecosystem, and generates clear root-cause hypotheses, with actionable recommendations. Even better, it could slot directly into automated workflows, eliminating manual steps entirely. The impact is clear: root-cause analysis time dropped from 30 minutes to about 2 minutes. That's real efficiency, real scale, and real value. This is innovation with purpose—solving a genuine pain point and elevating how we support our products and our customers.

We started the year running a robust set of campaigns—TechConnect Live Mountain Resort, the January Trends webinar, Upper Funnel Product, Business Intelligence release teaser messaging, Digital Event registration, 50 ABM 1x1 programs, 10 ABM cluster programs, and more. Shane and Anna—you were there from the start and ensured that campaigns were launched on time and KPIs were tracked with clear performance vs goal assessment. We worked with two external agencies, collaborating across time zones—no easy feat. Then came the summer slowdown and ultimately advertising freeze. In spite of the degree of change, you rallied and reinvented your scope—learning new skills, supporting organic efforts, and launching into 2026 planning. You have embraced and adapted to a new Performance Marketing team structure and CMO leadership. And then I decided to bring paid media buying in-house, hiring 4 new team members to support our campaigns! As if the worklife change was not enough, there were epic changes in your personal lives as well. Shane and Kerry welcomed baby Lily Rose! Anna and Matt got married—quietly buying land for a new house in Westborough!

Because of this team, TechCorp was able to launch 208 new brands spread between new gift cards, digitalization's and faceplates. We had some changes along the way to improve some processes, like bringing the onboarding to our project management system and also the improvement made in the email templates, which reduced the onboarding of any new gift card from 10 to 3 business days, making it possible to launch important brands like the digitalization of Pacific Retail in 35 days, Northern Stores in Ireland in 30 days and Metro Village in only 9 days since the ticket was raised, proving that if we improve a process in e-commerce, this automatically affects other departments and brings speed in delivering new offerings and client requests on the store.

You tackled one of the toughest challenges in engineering: modernising a 20-year-old legacy application without slowing the business down. Rather than spending weeks manually untangling 26,000+ lines of tightly coupled code, this team used Claude Code to map dependencies, analyse complexity, and prototype solutions in hours instead of weeks. You accelerated legacy analysis from ten days to one, cut prototyping time by more than half, and even used AI to improve onboarding for new engineers.  You embraced challenges, learned fast, and proved that modernising legacy systems doesn’t have to be painful—it can be intelligent, iterative, and empowering.  Congratulations for demonstrating innovative thinking and for showing how AI can turn uncertainty into clarity at remarkable speed.",1000,1145,Thomas Davis,Product Manager,Product,Director,"Product Knowledge,Problem Solving,Stakeholder Management",1234,Robert Thomas,Lead,Design,Senior Manager,B,Innovation & Problem Solving,B1,Technical Innovation,Solved complex technical challenges
535,2025-02-07,Innovation Award Most Innovative Mindset 1st Prize,"Congratulations on your Quack innovation, that gives us a glimpse into the future of intelligent, AI-Native development.  This is a complex innovation so for the Innovation POC  - focusing on the ECR vulnerabilities to demonstrate a thin slice of what Quack can do was an impressive approach. Developers have long faced a painful, repetitive workflow whenever a new vulnerability alert arrives, dig through the email, understand the issue, research the impact, open tickets, notify security, prepare code fixes, and push changes. It’s slow, it’s manual, and it pulls focus away from meaningful engineering work. Quack changes that completely. You created an AI-driven workflow that automatically identifies vulnerability notifications, interprets their content, investigates the issue, and generates a clear, structured ticket, complete with impact, proposed fixes, and assigned tasks. From there, developers step in to handle code changes: cloning the repository, creating a feature branch, preparing fixes, and sending them for human-in-the-loop approval before committing and pushing. It’s an end-to-end, intelligent pipeline that transforms what used to be a multi-step manual process into a streamlined, automated flow while keeping engineers firmly in control at the right checkpoints. This project shows what’s possible when we combine secure automation with thoughtful human oversight. It’s bold, it’s forward-looking, and it demonstrates real potential to enhance productivity across our engineering organisation. You are the driving team behind Quack, pushing the boundaries of what developer automation can achieve.

You addressed a challenge many of us face: navigating large datasets and relying heavily on documentation or expert support to get accurate answers. Your solution enables both technical and non-technical users to retrieve data through simple natural-language queries, helping reduce friction and improve clarity. DataQuery AI handles a wide range of use cases, presents results cleanly with supporting metadata, and has already shown potential for reuse, including possibility for integration with other innovation projects like Incident Intelligence. You also demonstrated a thoughtful approach to prompt design, continuous learning, and adapting as AI tools evolve. Well done for your practical and forward-looking innovation POC.",250,1315,Jennifer Davis,IT Manager,IT,Director,"Knowledge Transfer,Communication",1347,James Thomas,Support Lead,Customer Service,Senior IC,E,Professional Development & Growth,E3,Continuous Learning,Showed commitment to self-improvement
571,2025-02-20,Best Overall Innovation Award,"Congratulation on winning the Best Overall Innovation Award. Your Automated Translations innovation will make a meaningful difference for engineering teams across our entire organisation. As a global platform operating in more than 120 countries and supporting 40 languages, translations are part of our everyday reality. But for far too long, the process has been slow, manual, and frustrating. A single word change taking up to 10 days simply isn't acceptable in todays fast paced world. This team tackled that head-on with an innovation POC. By shifting from human-driven to AI-powered translations, integrating TranslateFlow's deployment workflows, and enabling faster, self-service releases through paved paths, you've reimagined the entire translation pipeline. What once took days could now be completed in one to two days, and during your demo we even saw updates appear in 20 minutes. The potential impact speaks for itself: - Up to 80% reduction in engineering overhead - Around 70% cost savings - Dramatically reduced waiting times and frustration for every squad that deals with multilingual content This is exactly the kind of innovation that lifts the whole organisation: practical, scalable, and immediately valuable. Congratulations again - you are setting a powerful standard for what thoughtful automation can achieve.",50,1164,Thomas Johnson,Director,Legal,Senior IC,"Certification,Process Improvement,Change Management",1031,James Hernandez,Manager,Legal,Senior IC,B,Innovation & Problem Solving,B1,Technical Innovation,Implemented cutting-edge technical approaches
572,2025-01-31,Innovation Awards - Popular Choice 2nd Place,"Congratulations on winning the 2nd Prize for Popular Choice award for your innovation project that resonates deeply with engineers across the organisation: Automated README File Creation. Every one of us knows the struggle—technical documentation is essential, but creating it consistently is slow, manual, and often deprioritised. That leads to onboarding challenges, gaps in cross-team understanding, and extra time wasted investigating issues. This team saw that pain clearly and built something genuinely impactful. Your solution automates high-quality README creation using a standardised AI prompt, powered by tools we already have through our enterprise agreements. The result is consistent, accurate documentation generated in minutes, not hours, complete with change history, architectural context, and links to supporting materials. Even better, these files can be automatically connected to our central ops-level repository for easy access. You rigorously tested the approach across multiple technologies, aligned the structure with the Pioneers and Neptune framework, and produced a clear, practical model for wider adoption. The benefits are straightforward: faster onboarding, stronger code comprehension, reduced investigative overhead, and documentation that can even serve as a trusted data source for future AI agents. This is smart, pragmatic innovation—solving a universal engineering frustration with a repeatable and scalable solution. Congratulations again, your innovation has the potential to make documentation easier, faster, and far more consistent across our engineering community.",250,1065,Richard Lopez,ML Engineer,Data Science,VP,"Documentation,Documentation,Product Knowledge",1429,Jessica Garcia,Lead,Design,Senior IC,B,Innovation & Problem Solving,B1,Technical Innovation,Leveraged technology for innovative solutions

Leadership isn't about titles. It's about the quiet consistency. The way you show up for your teams, even on the hard days. Especially on the hard days! This year threw a lot our way. And through it all, you showed up, with grace, with determination, and with an unwavering commitment to our people. I've seen you lead with empathy and integrity, even when things were unclear. Here's to the moments you celebrated others, the tough calls you made with heart, and the example you continue to set. I'm so grateful to be alongside you in this work here at TalentFirst and still believe we have the opportunity to shape something truly unique. Looking forward to 2026 and a year of positive change.

608,2025-07-04,Thank you for 2025.,"Hi team, As we look to close out the year, there is one thing I keep coming back to.... This year threw a LOT at us. We faced hard decisions. We said goodbye to people we care about. We felt the weight of change, and still, this team kept moving. Across both hiring and brand, your resilience has been something to witness. You didn't just hold the line, you kept building. When hiring slowed, you focused on the work behind the scenes: improving processes, tightening operations, setting us up for what's next. And now, as things have ramped up again and we faced a significant backlog with fewer hands, you're showing up with the same tenacity and drive. I know it hasn't been easy. But your ability to stay focused, deliver with integrity, and keep pushing forward is what makes this team what it is. Thank you for showing up, for each other, and for the business. I truly appreciate you all. Here's to an exciting 2026 as we finally get to look at our systems transformation and a future-ready org and operating model.

You've been absolutely exemplary in helping me understand all of this, and honestly, the knowledge I've gained through working with you has been transformative. What I appreciate most is how proactive you are. You don't just answer my questions; you anticipate what I'll need to know, share context before I even realize I need it, and make sure I truly understand the ""why"" behind the requirements. :)  Even though we haven't completed this journey yet, I already feel so much more confident in how I approach accessibility considerations in our product development.

What you may not know is that this result was over a year in the making. Jo was one of the first journalists I pitched when I joined Workhuman in April 2024. So when she reached out asking whether we had customers rewarding employees who experiment with AI, I knew we had one shot to deliver.  Erika, from the second I reached out, you were all over it—identifying paths forward, connecting the dots and opening the right doors. Your support, customer knowledge and constant check-ins were critical to securing the “yes” from Sanofi.  Dave, I’m so appreciative of how quickly you mobilized, reaching out to multiple accounts and pursuing every possible avenue. Even though those leads didn't materialize for this story, your willingness to jump in without hesitation truly embodied the teamwork that made this win possible.  Meghan and Sophia, your strategic insights and transparency not only helped us zero in on Sanofi as the right fit, but ensured we approached them the right way. Thank you for hearing me out, clearing the runway and co-signing this initiative.  Lynette, your persistence in securing the final approval was nothing short of heroic. Weeks of strategic and timely follow-ups resulted in full approval from a massive global enterprise—and a quote that celebrates Workhuman’s role in one of the world’s most influential global business publications. It reflects your sound judgment and the trust you’ve built with our customers.  Overall, this was a true testament to our values—Respect for Customers and Respect for Teamwork—and a powerful reminder of what we can accomplish when we operate with clarity, trust and a shared purpose.",250,1076,Matthew Gonzalez,Director,Marketing,Manager,"Quality Assurance,Documentation,Account Management,Problem Solving",1045,Charles Anderson,Attorney,Legal,IC,A,Leadership & Strategic Vision,A1,Visionary Leadership,Led strategic initiatives with measurable impact

You prepared with multiple people and also prepped me to join you. Your plan was thoughtful and specific to our audience and you were brave enough to flip the script and deliver it head on.  You naturally wove in PeopleFirst differentiators while presenting to Sarah (TechCorp's Listening and Engagement leader) what mattered most to her in her role. You were equally curious and got her talking about the recent acquisition by MegaBank, the competing incumbents (SolutionX and CompeteWell - being sunset 12/12) and what she anticipated for 2026. We learned about the organizations technology going forward (WorkSuite & MS365) we learned there would be a new collective set of values being delivered by the CEO imminently and that RIF's were likely still happening across as a result of  merging teams with duplicative roles.

I love to see how proactive you have been in driving forward these initiatives. For example, one key focus area has been to really understand why customers have historically delayed launches, and once we understand the major themes, building out plays and different strategies to address those common delays to minimize risk in the future for new launches. You took that initiative right on, leveraging AI Assistant to help summarize the major themes. What I appreciate so much is that you brought this to the team in our recent team meeting, helping the team understand what we are looking to do, how the information they are capturing is being used, and setting the stage that we will continue to iterate on how that information is captured in the future so we get the most impactful insights from the start.  Another fantastic example to call out is your focus on expanding the expertise across the team to be able to leverage all of Launch in sales/prospect meetings. In our recent Launch Review, you came up with the great idea to bring Quinn into the session, and you two built a phenomenal enablement session to support the initiative to expand our team's expertise. Lastly, I want to thank you for your dedication to continuous improvement when it comes to how we report out on Launch. From innovating the deck and insights provided, to creating a more automated way to populate the key launch insights and data points needed, we have made great strides here!

But the thing I appreciate most, which may sound trivial and elementary is your note taking. Your meeting/call notes function like my own personal AI memory bank: anytime I forget an action item, an instruction, or something we discussed, I Slack you (usually starting with ""sorry, I know I've asked you this 100 times before but...""), and within minutes you send back the exact details I need. You never complain, you always show up, and you always have a well organized, thorough answer. Your operational excellence keeps us moving forward, and your memory keeps me afloat.

From day one, she has made me feel comfortable, welcome, and truly part of both the team and the wider org.   What blows me away is that she's done all of this while just returning from maternity leave herself. Despite juggling so much, she has still carved out time to meet with me daily—walking me through tasks, sharing honest insights from the launch consulting role, and making sure I haven't felt lost or out of sorts. She is an incredibly patient and attentive teammate and brings so much warmth to every interaction.  I really appreciate her attention to detail and a prime example of this is her creating a personalised onboarding plan paired with a task management checklist which I admit, gives me an unreasonable amount of joy each time I complete a task. And thanks to her nudge, I've already started building a network of cross-functional peers - which have been some of my favorite chats so far.  When my son Oliver was sick and I needed to work from home, Jessica's understanding and reassurance made the world of difference. She removed the anxiety before it could settle in, and I can't tell you how much that support means to me as a new joiner and mum.  It's also been so lovely getting to know her on a personal level—our shared love of food (clearly a theme on the launch consultant team), the kids connection, the outdoors, our siblings… the list keeps growing. I know we're going to share many more laughs and ""omg me too!"" moments.  Thank you, Jessica, for your generosity, guidance, and the care you put into everything.
