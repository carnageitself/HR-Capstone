"As 2026 nears to an end I need to acknowledge the enormous win we have realized for WH Media and Workhuman at large. When comparing our advertising capability and experience from the beginning of the year to the end, it couldn't be more different. Our store has been brought to life with native but visually interesting and engaging ads that objectively improve the experience. That experience all started with a good design and vision for where we're going and what would be commercially viable. With that vision in place this team got to work with the various integrations which often required on the fly creative solutioning and incredible patience with our ad server partner, Osmos. Creating the inventory and ad units also required us to solve quite a few unforeseen challenges given the unique white labeled nature of our catalog and experience.  On top of all this the team was held to extremely rigid deadlines where sold ads needed to launch on a specific date. This made releasing tedious and required extensive orchestration with legacy ad commitments. This series of work positions us so well to grow this business. I can't wait for us to tackle the next big thing in 2026. Well done everyone!",2026 was a HUGE win for WH Media.,Principal Engineer,"Director, Store Experience"

"I want to take a moment to recognize the incredible work our focus group has accomplished since March in reimagining what was previously known as the 'department leads meeting.' What started as a traditional cross-department ceremony has evolved into something far more valuable—a space where department leaders truly connect, collaborate, and drive meaningful outcomes together. This transformation didn't happen by accident. It required commitment from each of you to plan thoughtfully, challenge conventions, and be willing to experiment. You pushed us beyond death by powerpoint, testing new formats and approaches that prioritized engagement and results over routine. The attendee feedback speaks for itself—we found the right formula by being bold enough to try different things and humble enough to learn from what resonated. Most importantly, you made it enjoyable. We proved that effective leadership meetings don't have to be a chore—they can be energizing, productive, and yes, even fun. As we head into 2026, we've built a strong foundation that will only continue to improve. Thank you for your dedication, creativity, and willingness to make this meeting something worth attending rather than just attending. Here's to building on this momentum in the year ahead.",Death by PowerPoint? Not on Our Watch,"Senior Director, Engineering","Director, Engineering"
"Marcus, as we close out the year, I want to recognize your exceptional leadership since joining our team mid-year. Stepping into this role under challenging circumstances required not only technical excellence but also tremendous adaptability and courage. You have risen to this challenge with a combination of optimism, resilience, and a steady presence that has become invaluable to our team. In an environment characterized by rapid pace and constant change, you have brought a sense of calm and focus that enables us all to perform at our best. Your dedication to shielding the team from unnecessary disruptions is remarkable and crucial to allowing us to concentrate on delivering the outcomes our business requires. From my vantage point, I see much of what you manage to protect the team from, but I've no doubt there's even more happening that you shield me from. What truly sets you apart are your people skills and genuine investment in supporting everyone around you. Your can-do attitude isn't just about positivity, it's backed by action, problem-solving, and an unwavering belief in what this team can accomplish together. Personally, during the last 6 months, your support and steadying influence have been instrumental in my ability to continue contributing effectively. Thank you for being a friend on difficult days. I'm grateful to work alongside you.","Exceptional Leadership, Profound Impact","Director, Engineering","Senior Manager, Engineering"

We celebrated an amazing award ceremony, recognized brilliant ideas, and saw happy inventors smiling with pride. Honestly—what more could we ask for? Thank you once again. It has been a great initiative to lead and an even greater experience to be part of. As I step out to take on a new mission—one that I hope will lift from Earth and go all the way to Mars—I carry with me deep appreciation for everything we built together.

"Thank you both for prioritizing and implementing the fix for Service Years scheduled job. We noticed a few months back that it was getting cutoff every day when it clashed with the release processes and additionally running into the following day for the second run. Service Years is a very important part of our system, that needs to run twice every day to guarantee delivery of emails and awards to literally thousands of people everyday. As you found out, some time back an unfortunate, seemingly small change, was made to seriously degrade the performance of the job, by an unrelated team. Viktor, you painstakingly identified the issue, zeroing in on where the time was been lost and implemented a fix delivering it to production on 10th Dec. We can now see Service Years has gone from taking ~7 hours on a typical day to ~3 hours on a typical day (heavy days can be multiple times). Marcus - this improvement would not have happened without your partnership and recognition of its importance to the normal running of the business, juggling other high pressure, high priority work items like 'media processing' and award loading for a new client launch. I know and recognize that was tricky to accomplish. Really appreciate both of your efforts on this and whoever else was involved, both in implementation and prioritization, that might have been invisible to me. Thanks to you all.",Prioritizing YOS performance,"Director, Engineering","Director, Cloud Infrastructure"

To me, this clearly reflects the ongoing commitment, dedication, collaboration, and leadership that each of you brings to the department. We had a hugely successful year, and every one of you, individually and collectively, played a pivotal role in that success. Of course, as leaders, we can never sit back or slow our efforts to keep improving. But we can and should take a moment to recognize and appreciate the great work we've done together. I wish you all a Merry Christmas.

"The end of the year is one of my favourite times, mostly because it naturally invites us to look back at all the ""wow,"" ""ugh,"" and ""did-that-really-happen?"" moments of the past months. And when I look back on 2025, I feel nothing but pride, and a huge part of that comes from getting to work alongside this strong leadership team. Your care, kindness, and resilience shine so brightly that your teams reflected it in the meaningful moments they're able to create for our customers. Sure, not everything this year was a walk in the park. Maybe some of it felt more like a hike in the rain with strong mountain wind! However, whenever challenges pop up, we know we can rely on each others knowledge, and experience, which is what makes us stronger every single time.

"Marcus, I figured I turn my IRL recognition shoutout into an official one for employee recognition :). Not enough words to described the incredible positive impact you've had since starting your TechFlow tenure which, believe it or not, it's barely 7 months old. Big shifts happened the week you started – the team you were leading got bigger and joined a new function, new priorities were still in flux... all that alone is a lot to take in. But on top of it, you also had the entire company onboarding process, so... water from a fire-hose x1000?! Through it all and since, you've been a leader who's supportive, empathetic, collaborative, decisive, thoughtful, inclusive, and – probably more importantly – a someone who sees and believes in their people and their potential for growth. Thank you for being you!",Leadership at its finest,"Senior Director, Creative","Director, Creative"
"Congratulations to this group for supporting a real-life behavioral science experiment—quantifying the halo effect of paid media on website traffic and responses. As a business, we've known for years that core drivers of Demo Requests and Contact Us Sales responses come from direct load, organic search, and paid search sources. In 2025 we had the chance to observe for the first time ever what it would mean if one of those 3 sources shut off—the advertising freeze! The correlation was clear: paid search went to 0 while organic search and direct load traffic to the employee engagement platform page and responses dropped over 60%. The trend line was compelling, but we needed to rule out other factors. Sarah, Alex, and Emma—you supported the analysis understanding organic trends, proving that in fact core employee recognition terms were gaining organic ranking ground and search traffic fluctuation was negligible. David and Michael, you were at the helm of NA and EMEA paid search this year, pivoting by month and by quarter as budgets shifted and took on in-house management responsibility with the relaunch in December. As we go full-steam ahead in January, I look forward to watching the trend line reverse. This time we'll be able to better calculate total business ROI and make optimizations accordingly. This is a huge insight driving our marketing investment!",Quest for the halo effect of search marketing,Digital Marketing Manager,"Senior Director, Paid Media"

We've spent countless hours together talking through the space and I know you have spent 10x that on your own. You have exemplified the thoughtfulness and quality we strive to have on our team not only in information collected but how you collected it. Less than 24 hours after talking through solution options, you had prototype coded a user interface mockup. The solutions we are getting to are going to be a game changer for our business.

It was lovely to see how you approached each type of comment and broke things down so clearly in the design specs and accessibility annotation. Very interesting to see the display media work you're progressing too. I know that this has a lot of nuance to this and it was interesting to hear how animated content has their own particular challenges in terms of accessibility.

"Avery, I want to take a moment to acknowledge all of your contributions and successes to Customer Comms over the past six months ✨ You hit the ground running in marketing and were ready with ideas, those especially shone through in our Recognition Awards campaign. Despite never having worked on a campaign like this in marketing, you didn't shy away from creating a strategy, and setting the pace and tone of what you thought our approach should be - all while moving into a new department with a new team, and new leadership. You were able to rally our team behind you and connect the dots with other departments, ensuring we met our (very tight) deadlines to get our first Special Events series out the door. You were quick to accept the adjustments that come with marketing, including adding new channels into the mix, and pivoting on messaging at the last minute. Then you did something that is always challenging - you trusted the vision and the new collaborators, leading to incredible results (dear reader - please see our deck if you're curious). You did all of this while being a person, navigating the challenges of life's ups and downs, and though you may be one of the top award ""distributors"" in marketing, it's your turn to be recognized 😄 Thank you for your extraordinary work this H2!",There's nothing Gnormal about you!,Practice Leader and Strategist,Community Marketing Programs Manager

"Congratulations on winning the Popular Choice Award to Smart Diagnostics, an innovation that our engineering community is excited about. This innovation started with a simple but powerful insight: our engineers were losing too much time hunting through logs, dashboards, ticket systems, and documentation just to understand what went wrong. This team set out to change that, and they delivered something remarkable. Smart Diagnostics is an AI-driven incident analyst that aims to automatically interprets error logs and stack traces, identifies ownership, pulls relevant context from across our ecosystem, and generates clear root-cause hypotheses, with actionable recommendations. Even better, it could slot directly into automated workflows, eliminating manual steps entirely. The impact is clear: root-cause analysis time dropped from 30 minutes to about 2 minutes. That's real efficiency, real scale, and real value. This is innovation with purpose—solving a genuine pain point and elevating how we support our products and our customers. Congratulations to this team behind Smart Diagnostics, and thank you for delivering an outstanding contribution that clearly resonated across the engineering organisation. Looking forward to seeing how we can evolve this from a POC to solve even greater toil issues with improved recommendations",Innovation Award Popular Choice 1st Place,Senior Software Engineer,"Senior Director, Engineering"

We started the year running a robust set of campaigns—TechConnect Live Mountain Resort, the January Trends webinar, Upper Funnel Product, Business Intelligence release teaser messaging, Digital Event registration, 50 ABM 1x1 programs, 10 ABM cluster programs, and more. Shane and Anna—you were there from the start and ensured that campaigns were launched on time and KPIs were tracked with clear performance vs goal assessment. We worked with two external agencies, collaborating across time zones—no easy feat. Then came the summer slowdown and ultimately advertising freeze. In spite of the degree of change, you rallied and reinvented your scope—learning new skills, supporting organic efforts, and launching into 2026 planning. You have embraced and adapted to a new Performance Marketing team structure and CMO leadership. And then I decided to bring paid media buying in-house, hiring 4 new team members to support our campaigns! As if the worklife change was not enough, there were epic changes in your personal lives as well. Shane and Kerry welcomed baby Lily Rose!

Emma, thank you for developing a proposed process and moving it forward by bringing all of the key stakeholders together across our respective teams. This laid the foundation for us to make this proposal a reality.

Q4 is a very busy month for our clients as they rush to tie any loose ends before the new year, and it's TS who steps in to ensure the loose ends are tied! When MegaCorp's monetary awards were disabled and pushed live before the intended date, you were able to revert the changes and enable monetary awards within the same day. You spent the entire working day providing updates to me and you also opened new tickets with the platform team to make the changes you were unable to make. Each new ticket you opened, you always tagged me on for visibility purposes. As you actively provided me with updates, it allowed me to actively provide the PM updates, which she was very appreciative of. You treated the situation as if it was a client of your own and I cannot thank you enough.

"Hey Team, As we approach another end of the year, I would like to say a huge thank you in my name and in the name of the Site Merchandising team for another successful year working together on a daily basis! Because of this team, TechCorp was able to launch 208 new brands spread between new gift cards, digitalization's and faceplates. We had some changes along the way to improve some processes, like bringing the onboarding to our project management system and also the improvement made in the email templates, which reduced the onboarding of any new gift card from 10 to 3 business days, making it possible to launch important brands like the digitalization of Pacific Retail in 35 days, Northern Stores in Ireland in 30 days and Metro Village in only 9 days since the ticket was raised, proving that if we improve a process in e-commerce, this automatically affects other departments and brings speed in delivering new offerings and client requests on the store.

"Congratulations on winning 2nd Place for Most Innovative Mindset innovation award. You tackled one of the toughest challenges in engineering: modernising a 20-year-old legacy application without slowing the business down. Rather than spending weeks manually untangling 26,000+ lines of tightly coupled code, this team used Claude Code to map dependencies, analyse complexity, and prototype solutions in hours instead of weeks. You accelerated legacy analysis from ten days to one, cut prototyping time by more than half, and even used AI to improve onboarding for new engineers.  You embraced challenges, learned fast, and proved that modernising legacy systems doesn’t have to be painful—it can be intelligent, iterative, and empowering.  Congratulations for demonstrating innovative thinking and for showing how AI can turn uncertainty into clarity at remarkable speed.",Innovation - Most Innovative Mindset 2nd Place,Principal Engineer,"Senior Director, Engineering"
"Congratulations on your Quack innovation, that gives us a glimpse into the future of intelligent, AI-Native development.  This is a complex innovation so for the Innovation POC  - focusing on the ECR vulnerabilities to demonstrate a thin slice of what Quack can do was an impressive approach. Developers have long faced a painful, repetitive workflow whenever a new vulnerability alert arrives, dig through the email, understand the issue, research the impact, open tickets, notify security, prepare code fixes, and push changes. It’s slow, it’s manual, and it pulls focus away from meaningful engineering work. Quack changes that completely. You created an AI-driven workflow that automatically identifies vulnerability notifications, interprets their content, investigates the issue, and generates a clear, structured ticket, complete with impact, proposed fixes, and assigned tasks. From there, developers step in to handle code changes: cloning the repository, creating a feature branch, preparing fixes, and sending them for human-in-the-loop approval before committing and pushing. It’s an end-to-end, intelligent pipeline that transforms what used to be a multi-step manual process into a streamlined, automated flow while keeping engineers firmly in control at the right checkpoints. This project shows what’s possible when we combine secure automation with thoughtful human oversight. It’s bold, it’s forward-looking, and it demonstrates real potential to enhance productivity across our engineering organisation. You are the driving team behind Quack, pushing the boundaries of what developer automation can achieve. Congratulations!",Innovation Award Most Innovative Mindset 1st Prize,"Manager, Engineering","Senior Director, Engineering"

Our deep dive around vision and mission set a strong foundation, and it was inspiring to see how quickly we aligned on a shared sense of direction.

"Congratulations on winning the 3rd Place for Most Innovative Mindset to this team who created DataQuery AI, an AI assistant designed to make working with complex databases more accessible. You addressed a challenge many of us face: navigating large datasets and relying heavily on documentation or expert support to get accurate answers. Your solution enables both technical and non-technical users to retrieve data through simple natural-language queries, helping reduce friction and improve clarity. DataQuery AI handles a wide range of use cases, presents results cleanly with supporting metadata, and has already shown potential for reuse, including possibility for integration with other innovation projects like Incident Intelligence. You also demonstrated a thoughtful approach to prompt design, continuous learning, and adapting as AI tools evolve. Well done for your practical and forward-looking innovation POC.",Innovation Most Innovative Mindset 3rd Place,Senior Software Engineer,"Senior Director, Engineering"
"Congratulation on winning the Best Overall Innovation Award. Your Automated Translations innovation will make a meaningful difference for engineering teams across our entire organisation. As a global platform operating in more than 120 countries and supporting 40 languages, translations are part of our everyday reality. But for far too long, the process has been slow, manual, and frustrating. A single word change taking up to 10 days simply isn't acceptable in todays fast paced world. This team tackled that head-on with an innovation POC. By shifting from human-driven to AI-powered translations, integrating TranslateFlow's deployment workflows, and enabling faster, self-service releases through paved paths, you've reimagined the entire translation pipeline. What once took days could now be completed in one to two days, and during your demo we even saw updates appear in 20 minutes. The potential impact speaks for itself: - Up to 80% reduction in engineering overhead - Around 70% cost savings - Dramatically reduced waiting times and frustration for every squad that deals with multilingual content This is exactly the kind of innovation that lifts the whole organisation: practical, scalable, and immediately valuable. Congratulations again - you are setting a powerful standard for what thoughtful automation can achieve.",Best Overall Innovation Award,Junior Software Engineer Shadow Worker,"Senior Director, Engineering"
"Congratulations on winning the 2nd Prize for Popular Choice award for your innovation project that resonates deeply with engineers across the organisation: Automated README File Creation. Every one of us knows the struggle—technical documentation is essential, but creating it consistently is slow, manual, and often deprioritised. That leads to onboarding challenges, gaps in cross-team understanding, and extra time wasted investigating issues. This team saw that pain clearly and built something genuinely impactful. Your solution automates high-quality README creation using a standardised AI prompt, powered by tools we already have through our enterprise agreements. The result is consistent, accurate documentation generated in minutes, not hours, complete with change history, architectural context, and links to supporting materials. Even better, these files can be automatically connected to our central ops-level repository for easy access. You rigorously tested the approach across multiple technologies, aligned the structure with the Pioneers and Neptune framework, and produced a clear, practical model for wider adoption. The benefits are straightforward: faster onboarding, stronger code comprehension, reduced investigative overhead, and documentation that can even serve as a trusted data source for future AI agents. This is smart, pragmatic innovation—solving a universal engineering frustration with a repeatable and scalable solution. Congratulations again, your innovation has the potential to make documentation easier, faster, and far more consistent across our engineering community.",Innovation Awards - Popular Choice 2nd Place,Principal Engineer,"Senior Director, Engineering"

Thank you for hearing me out, clearing the runway and co-signing this initiative.  Lynette, your persistence in securing the final approval was nothing short of heroic. Weeks of strategic and timely follow-ups resulted in full approval from a massive global enterprise—and a quote that celebrates Workhuman’s role in one of the world’s most influential global business publications. It reflects your sound judgment and the trust you’ve built with our customers.

"Sofia, thank you so much for all the amazing work you did recently with MediCore and organizing all their translations in one place.  When configuring this client and when we were close to push live the PM flagged that all the translation works done during launch had reverted. This wasn't an easy task as we didn't have a master file with all translations and had to puzzle everything into one piece.  Once you got looped into this project you immediately rolled up your sleeves and put all old and new translations into one place and you even added notes and text properties to it. In addition to this you kept all stakeholders updated, raised new tickets (with Design Team) and kept following up with other teams when needed!! Please know that you are very cherished and appreciated! Thank you for being so awesome.",Ensuring quality standards for MediCore,Senior Technical Services Specialist,Customer Success Manager

"It was fantastic to see such a significant milestone go live yesterday - the fact that we're now able to limit data access at the report level, rather than applying limitations to the underlying data sources, means that we can prevent data access 'leaking' between reports and being a constant source of confusion for customers and internal stakeholders alike.  As well as the consumers of these reports, this is also a significant win for Report Authors, who have, until now, not been able to verify the contents of reports they create and share. For the first time, they will now be able to see the same restrictions being applied in these reports as the recipients of the reports themselves.  Thank you all for your excellent work to plan, deliver and thoroughly test this incredibly complex change!

To the panel - Blake, Ryan, Sophie, Hannah, Chris, Lauren. Each of you brought such an incredible and thoughtful perspective to every interaction, and every discussion about each candidate.

This was my favorite recruiting cycle to date - not just because I like working with you, but because you showcased urgency, quality, thoughtfulness, and strong communication throughout. It's funny to reflect on it because I remember YOU being the recruiter that helped me come to TalentForward, and you did everything with the same panache this time around that you did 4.5 years ago for me.

You took that initiative right on, leveraging AI Assistant to help summarize the major themes. What I appreciate so much is that you brought this to the team in our recent team meeting, helping the team understand what we are looking to do, how the information they are capturing is being used, and setting the stage that we will continue to iterate on how that information is captured in the future so we get the most impactful insights from the start.  Another fantastic example to call out is your focus on expanding the expertise across the team to be able to leverage all of Launch in sales/prospect meetings.

Lastly, I want to thank you for your dedication to continuous improvement when it comes to how we report out on Launch. From innovating the deck and insights provided, to creating a more automated way to populate the key launch insights and data points needed, we have made great strides here!

"Sam, thank you for being the operational backbone of our team and the metaphorical external hard drive for our paid media team, housing all day to day operational knowledge. Your organization, speed, and absolute mastery of every process/workflow/behind-the-scenes detail make you the person I rely on more than anyone. Whether it's the paid social creative best-practices doc you built, somehow distilling hundreds of nuances into a clean, usable table, or the UTM builder you keep perfectly updated every quarter, or the plug-and-play paid media brief deck you created for every campaign launch, or the work you've done being the first to dive into trafficking ads in our social platform now that we've taken those processes in house, everything you touch becomes clearer, easier, and more efficient for the entire team and gets stored in this metaphorical external hard drive for all of us to reference while executing day to day campaign/program management. But the thing I appreciate most, which may sound trivial and elementary is your note taking. Your meeting/call notes function like my own personal AI memory bank: anytime I forget an action item, an instruction, or something we discussed, I Slack you (usually starting with ""sorry, I know I've asked you this 100 times before but...""), and within minutes you send back the exact details I need. You never complain, you always show up, and you always have a well organized, thorough answer. Your operational excellence keeps us moving forward, and your memory keeps me afloat. Thank you for being the most reliable, organized, and indispensable source of truth for all things paid media. We're better because of you!",The Human External Hard Drive Award,Paid Media Manager,Senior Paid Media Manager
"Devon, on behalf of the Paid Media team, thank you so much for the diligence you have demonstrated in setting up our API reporting tokens across 5 key platforms. There were unique challenges faced in this project: different APIs for each platform depending on ad type, applications to submit for custom approval of ""app setup"", error codes/roadblocks that only online forums and AI tools could answer for you in a timely manner. In the past, we relied on agency and platform sales rep support for answers. In this new way of working, you are more agile and self-service.

Reflecting on your contribution, I see you are especially gifted with proactivity, respectfulness and clarity in communication, bravery in presenting, systematic organization, thoroughness, and intellect. This year has been especially turbulent—but I can see your accomplishments clearly: owning the full lifecycle of our annual conference advertising, executing on the product intelligence event and upper funnel brand effort, more independence in vendor research, supporting the meteoric new brand initiative, overhauling our utm trafficking doc taxonomy, and so much more. You are also a warm person to spend time with, empathetic and ready for a laugh. Celebrating your perfect coastal wedding at the top of this very month felt like a milestone for our whole team, knowing how much of your personal effort and dreams went into everything.

I remember pre-TalentTech thinking that this guy really CARES about getting the job done right but is also so playful. It's a careful balance—but somehow it's Devon!

When I had the interview for the senior role, you hopped on a call to talk me through how to prepare. When I came to you with situations I needed navigating you talked me through how you would handle it and how gave me recommendations. When I was feeling overwhelmed you directed me to list what was consuming my time and figure out a priority list.

"Anton this award is somewhat overdue. I wanted to take a minute to thank you for all of the support you have been showing Denis during his onboarding. You have helped ensure that his transition into Branding was as seamless as possible. I know how much he has valued being able to reach out to you as needed, and the clear swift help you've provided. Thank you for that. But I also need to thank you for something else. Anton your contribution over the years to the Branding team has been outstanding. I am not sure people understand exactly how much help you have been to us and our customers. The noted uptick in quality from when you joined our team - way back - was and is so impressive. Your exacting eye for detail, your attitude, your teamwork, your good humour and your friendly style, has been such a boost for the team. We are sad to see you move on to another team, but thrilled that you are still only a click away on Slack. A massive thank you Anton for all that you contributed to Branding over the years. You're a big part of why the Branding team has gone from strength to strength. Your ongoing support with Denis shows how much you care about Branding too. So, thank you Anton. On behalf of Val, Aidan, Cliona and myself - not to mention Denis, Lucas and Laura - thank you and great job! Take a bow.",Thank you for everything Ihar!,Software Engineer,"Senior Manager, Product Design"
"Hi Jake, I just wanted to say thank you for giving me a hand, actually, for taking on the automation yourself when it went over my head. The previous automation message was quite generic and didn't provide much context whenever a change was made to the page. It also caused confusion because a message was sent even when something was removed, showing as an update. I really appreciate the effort and thought you put into this small change. It will make a meaningful difference for our team.",Confluence automation,Customer Service Technical Specialist,"Team Leader, Customer Service Operations"

"Alex, I want to take a moment to recognize the outstanding work you put into organizing and executing Security Week in November. What you accomplished was truly impressive - you coordinated a complex, multi-month effort that required careful planning with our vendor partner SecureTech, ensuring all our teams were prepared and ready to participate, and managing all the logistics throughout the week itself, right down to keeping everyone fueled with doughnuts and pizzas. The results speak for themselves: over 2,500 security issues resolved during the week. That's a tremendous achievement that significantly strengthens our security posture, and it's a direct result of your dedication and attention to detail in making this event a success. What often goes unseen is all the work you did behind the scenes throughout the week - ensuring teams could get impediments cleared quickly and efficiently so they could maintain momentum and keep making progress. That kind of responsive support was critical to achieving the results we saw. What's equally impressive is that you're not resting on these results. You're already looking ahead, planning what we need to do to build on this momentum and have our teams ready for January 1st when we take the next step in improving our security posture.

"I'd love to recognise Jessica for being an exceptional onboarding buddy over the past month (and ongoing). From day one, she has made me feel comfortable, welcome, and truly part of both the team and the wider org.   What blows me away is that she's done all of this while just returning from maternity leave herself. Despite juggling so much, she has still carved out time to meet with me daily—walking me through tasks, sharing honest insights from the launch consulting role, and making sure I haven't felt lost or out of sorts. She is an incredibly patient and attentive teammate and brings so much warmth to every interaction.  I really appreciate her attention to detail and a prime example of this is her creating a personalised onboarding plan paired with a task management checklist which I admit, gives me an unreasonable amount of joy each time I complete a task. And thanks to her nudge, I've already started building a network of cross-functional peers - which have been some of my favorite chats so far.  When my son Oliver was sick and I needed to work from home, Jessica's understanding and reassurance made the world of difference. She removed the anxiety before it could settle in, and I can't tell you how much that support means to me as a new joiner and mum.  It's also been so lovely getting to know her on a personal level—our shared love of food (clearly a theme on the launch consultant team), the kids connection, the outdoors, our siblings… the list keeps growing. I know we're going to share many more laughs and ""omg me too!"" moments.  Thank you, Jessica, for your generosity, guidance, and the care you put into everything.
